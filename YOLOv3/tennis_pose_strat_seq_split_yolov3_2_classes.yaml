# YOLOv8 Dataset Configuration File
# 
# This file tells the YOLOv8 trainer where to find your data and
# what your classes and keypoints are.
#
# To train, run:
# yolo pose train data=tennis_pose.yaml model=yolov8n-pose.pt epochs=100 ...
#
# Make sure the paths are correct relative to where you run the command.
# Or, use absolute paths.

# Paths to train/val images
# Update this path if 'yolo_tennis_dataset' is not in the same directory
# as where you run your 'yolo' command.
train: ./yolo_tennis_dataset_seq_strat_corrected_v3_only_bbox_2_classes/images/train
val: ./yolo_tennis_dataset_seq_strat_corrected_v3_only_bbox_2_classes/images/val

# Number of classes

# Class names
